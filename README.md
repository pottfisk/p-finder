# P-finder
Paananen-finder is a client-server solution for displaying and updating the location of all Paananen family members.
The client is written with python3 and reads data from a file. It then displays all family members on a map. 
The server takes input from webclients when they update the map. The purpose is to some day install this in on a raspberry pi and connect to a HD screen and display in some room. Every family member can then access the webpage and update their location and it would change on the screen.
